ELRSk8 is an open source remote for DIY electric skateboard utilizing the power of ExpressLRS.
Main features I tried to achieve with this project:

1. Get reliable low latency connection, better that off the shelf remotes, NRF or BLE protocols. ELRS seems like the best open source link right now with superior interference and failsafe handling.
2. Durable throttle control with bearings, high reliability sensor and tension adjustment.
3. Ergonomic grip for use with wrist guards and gloves.
4. Basic telemetry
5. Easily sourced components and 3d printed shell.

Code is based on [Simple TX](https://github.com/kkbin505/Arduino-Transmitter-for-ELRS) by @kkbin505
